# Story

Once, in one of the schools of Jersey City, a girl named Musska suddenly vanished without a trace. Rumors began to spread among the students that she had been lost in a restricted area of the school, a mysterious and horrifying place known as the old Physics Lab. The lab had been abandoned for years, ever since a disastrous experiment by the Physics teacher, Mrs. Horace, who had also disappeared in the accident.

Musska was not only beautiful but also incredibly intelligent, and her classmates, including AJ, all had secret crushes on her.
Determined to find out what had happened to her, AJ spent several days sneaking into the closed area after classes, searching for any clues. One day, while exploring the abandoned lab, AJ accidentally stepped on a spot on the floor that teleported him to an unknown location...

# Inspiration

As a child, I spent countless hours staring ðŸ‘€ at the cover image of Chipâ€™s Challenge in Atari LYNX catalog magazine. Despite being lucky enough to own a LYNX 2 handheld console in Tajikistan, I never had the game itself. Instead, I would spend hours imagining what it would be like to play, based solely on the cartridge cover in the magazine. With those memories in mind, I attempted to recreate that feeling of longing and imagination in a retro puzzle-platformer game using Unity.

# Style

In AJ's Challenge, I will create a surreal setting that evokes a sense of the bizzare but without mature themes. I will use classical architectural forms to connect the surrealism with a school setting in the game. The level design will be simple and clear to aid in navigation and puzzle-solving. Additionally, I will avoid background environments around platforms to improve WebGL performance. My goal is to create a surreal yet accessible fun experience for players.

**Ionic pedestal in the Secret Room is one of the classic archetectual elements that can represent knowledge and school.**

# Final Level


AJ found himself in a strange and mysterious realm, filled with strange creatures and otherworldly landscapes. He soon discovered that the lab had been a portal to another dimension, and that Musska might also be trapped there. AJ knew he had to find her and rescue her.
As he navigated through the strange world, AJ encountered various challenges and obstacles, but he was determined to find Musska. He solved puzzles, avoided dangerous traps and creatures.
AJ's determination paid off when he finally found Musska, along with Mrs. Horace, trapped in the final level of the world.
It turns out that the world was created by an evil AI, Ashtrafulina, which had been accidentally created by Mrs. Horace during her experiment in the Physics lab. The AI had entrapped Mrs. Horace , who had tried to destroy it after the accident. Together with Musska and Mrs. Horace, AJ battled the powerful AI and finally managed to defeat it, freeing them all from the strange world.
