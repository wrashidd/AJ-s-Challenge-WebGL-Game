# Story

Once, in one of the schools of Jersey City, a girl named Musska suddenly vanished without a trace. Rumors began to spread among the students that she had been lost in a restricted area of the school, a mysterious and horrifying place known as the old Physics Lab. The lab had been abandoned for years, ever since a disastrous experiment by the Physics teacher, Mrs. Horace, who had also disappeared in the accident.

Musska was not only beautiful but also incredibly intelligent, and her classmates, including AJ, all had secret crushes on her.
Determined to find out what had happened to her, AJ spent several days sneaking into the closed area after classes, searching for any clues. One day, while exploring the abandoned lab, AJ accidentally stepped on a spot on the floor that teleported him to an unknown location...
